          <div id="prayer1" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">O Lord, God and Savior Jesus Christ, treasure of
            mercy and source of salvation, I come to You
            confessing my sins. I confess that I insolently
            dared to defile Your holy sanctuary with my sins.
            Now I seek Your mercy and lovingkindness, for
            Your mercies are countless and You never turn
            back a sinner who comes to You.
            I confess that my mind is burdened with sin and I
            have no strength left. Do not turn away from me in
            Your anger nor punish me in Your wrath. I am
            worn out, have compassion upon me, O Lord, and
            judge me not in Your justice, but according to Your
            mercy.
            Remember Your creation, O God, do not put me
            on trial for none of Your servants can justify his
            deeds. Dress me in a new attire that befits Your
            glory. Forgive my sins and I shall sing saying:
            Blessed is he whose sins are forgiven." When I
            confess my sins, and reveal my iniquities, You
            cleanse me.<br><br>
            Amen.</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('prayer2')">Prayer Before Confession</li>
          <div id="prayer2" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">O holy Father, who longs to the sinners return,
            who promised to accept those who repent, look at
            a soul that was long lost in the valleys of
            disobedience.
            I have long tasted the bitterness of misery, being
            away from the source of salvation.
            Now I come back to You to be purified, accept me
            and do not reject me, for when You look at me
            with mercy and compassion, I will be cleansed and
            saved but if You turn away from me I will perish.
            Grant me, O Lord, Your blessings to strengthen my
            will to come closer to You in faith and hope, to
            confess my sins and detest returning to them.
            Let Your Holy Spirit remind me not to stray.
            Enlighten my heart, O God, so that I can see the
            graveness of my sins and negligence, and have the
            will to obey Your commandments and live.
            For the glory of Your holy name.<br><br>
            Amen.</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('prayer3')">Prayer After Confession</li>
          <div id="prayer3" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">O Father, I am grateful for Your goodness, and love
            of mankind. You did not wish that I perish, but
            awakened me from my sleep and guided me to
            Your way.
            You saved me from the valley of death to the
            protection Of Your strong fortress.
            Fill me with hope and faith, I come to You like the
            sick wishing to be healed, like the hungry seeking
            to be filled, like the poor to the source of riches
            and the sinner to the redeemer, and like the dying
            to the origin of life.
            You are my salvation, my health my life and my
            strength, with You I find consolation, happiness
            and comfort. Help me, protect me and surround
            me with Your goodness, teach me to put my will in
            Your hands and live according to Your will.
            Remove my weakness so that I may be firm and
            honest to You to the end.<br><br>
            Amen.</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('psalm50')">Psalm 50(51)</li>
          <div id="psalm50" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your
            great mercy; and according to the multitude of
            Your compassions blot out my iniquity. Wash me
            thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from
            my sin. For I am conscious of my iniquity; and my
            sin is at all times before me.<br><br>
            Against You only I have sinned, and done evil
            before You: that You might be just in Your sayings,
            and might overcome when You are judged. For,
            behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins
            my mother conceived me.'<br><br>
            For, behold, You have loved the truth: You have
            manifested to me the hidden and unrevealed
            things of Your wisdom. You shall sprinkle me with
            Your hyssop, and I shall be purified: You shall wash
            me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. You
            shall make me to hear gladness and joy: the
            humbled bones shall rejoice.'<br><br>
            Turn away Your face from my sins, and blot out all
            my iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, O God;
            and renew a right spirit in my inward parts. Do not
            cast me away from Your face; and do not remove
            Your Holy Spirit from me. Give me the joy of Your
            salvation: and uphold me with a directing spirit.
            Then I shall teach the transgressors Your ways;
            and the ungodly men shall turn to You.<br><br>
            'Deliver me from blood, O God, the God of my
            salvation: and my tongue shall rejoice in Your
            righteousness. O Lord, You shall open my lips; and
            my mouth shall declare Your praise. For if You
            desired sacrifice, I would have given it: You do not
            take pleasure in burnt offerings. The sacrifice of
            God is a broken spirit: a broken and humbled
            heart God shall not despise.'<br><br>
            DO good, O Lord, in Your good pleasure to Zion;
            and let the walls of Jerusalem be built. Then You
            shall be pleased with sacrifices of righteousness,
            offering, and burnt sacrifices: then they shall offer
            calves upon Your altar.<br><br>
            ALLELUIA.</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('psalm6')">Psalm 6</li>
          <div id="psalm6" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, nor
            chasten me in Your hot displeasure. Have mercy
            on me, O LORD, for I am weak; O LORD, heal me,
            for my bones are troubled.
            My soul also is greatly troubled; but You, O LORD
            —how long? Return, O LORD, deliver me!
            Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake! For in death
            there is no remembrance of You; in the grave who
            will give You thanks? I am weary with my groaning;
            all night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch
            with my tears.
            My eye wastes away because Of grief; it grows Old
            because of all my enemies.
            Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; for the
            LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.
            The LORD has heard my supplication The LORD
            will receive my prayer. Let all my enemies be
            ashamed and greatly troubled; let them turn back
            and be ashamed suddenly.</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('psalm31')">Psalm 31(32)</li>
          <div id="psalm31" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
            Whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man to whom
            the Lord does not impute iniquity, and in whose
            spirit there is no deceit.<br><br>
            When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my
            groaning all the day long. For day and night Your
            hand was heavy upon me; my vitality was turned
            into the drought of summer.<br><br>
            I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I
            have not hidden. I said, "l will confess my
            transgressions to the Lord," and You forgave the
            iniquity Of my sin. Selah<br><br>
            For this cause everyone who is godly shall pray to
            You in a time when You may be found; surely in a
            flood of great waters they shall not come near
            him.<br><br>
            You are my hiding place; you shall preserve me
            from trouble; you shall surround me with songs Of
            deliverance.<br><br>
            I will instruct you and teach you in the way you
            should go; i will guide you with My eye. Do not be
            like the horse or like the mule,
            Which have no understanding, which must be
            harnessed with bit and bridle, else they will not
            come near you.<br><br>
            Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; but he who
            trusts in the Lord, mercy shall surround him.
            Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous;
            And shout for joy, all you upright in heart!</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('psalm37')">Psalm 37(38)</li>
          <div id="psalm37" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your wrath, nor
            chasten me in Your hot displeasure! For Your
            arrows pierce me deeply, and Your hand presses
            me down.<br><br>
            There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your
            anger, nor any health in my bones because Of my
            sin.<br><br>
            For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a
            heavy burden they are too heavy for me. My
            wounds are foul and festering because Of my
            foolishness.<br><br>
            I am troubled, I am bowed down greatly; I go
            mourning all the day long. For my loins are full of
            inflammation, and there is no soundness in my
            flesh. I am feeble and severely broken; I groan
            because of the turmoil of my heart.<br><br>
            Lord, all my desire is before You; and my sighing is
            not hidden from You. my heart pants, my strength
            fails me; as for the light Of my eyes, it also has
            gone from me.<br><br>
            My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my
            plague, and my relatives stand afar off. Those also
            who seek my life lay snares for me; those who
            seek my hurt speak of destruction, and plan
            deception all the day long. But l, like a deaf man,
            do not hear: and I am like a mute who does not open his mouth.
            Thus, I am like a man who does not hear, and in
            whose mouth is no response.<br><br>
            For in You, O Lord, I hope; You will hear, O Lord my
            God. For I said, "Hear me, lest they rejoice over me,
            lest, when my foot slips, they exalt themselves
            against me."<br><br>
            For I am ready to fall, and my sorrow is continually
            before me. For I will declare my iniquity; I will be in
            anguish over my sin. But my enemies are vigorous,
            and they are strong; and those who hate me
            wrongfully have multiplied.<br><br>
            Those also who render evil for good, they are my
            adversaries, because I follow what is good.
            Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, be not far
            from me! Make haste to help me, O Lord, my
            salvation!</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('psalm102')">Psalm 102(103)</li>
          <div id="psalm102" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me,
            bless His holy name! Bless the Lord, O my soul,
            and forget not all His benefits: who forgives all
            your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who
            redeems your life from destruction, who crowns
            you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, who
            satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your
            youth is renewed like the eagle's.<br><br>
            The Lord executes righteousness and justice for all
            who are oppressed. He made known His ways to
            Moses, His acts to the children of Israel. The Lord
            is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
            abounding in mercy. He will not always strive with
            us, nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not
            dealt with us according to our sins, nor punished
            us according to our iniquities.<br><br>
            For as the heavens are high above the earth, so
            great is His mercy toward those who fear Him; as
            far as the east is from the west, so far has He
            removed our transgressions from us. As a father
            pities his children, so the Lord pities those who
            fear Him.<br><br>
            For He knows our frame; He remembers that we
            are dust. As for man, his days are like grass; as a
            flower Of the field, so he flourishes. For the wind
            passes over it, and it is gone, and its place
            remembers it no more.<br><br>
            But the mercy Of the Lord is from everlasting to
            everlasting on those who fear Him, and His
            righteousness to children's children, to such as
            keep His covenant, and to those who remember
            His commandments to do them.<br><br>
            The Lord has established His throne in heaven,
            and His kingdom rules over all.
            Bless the Lord, you His angels, who excel in
            strength, who do His word, heeding the voice of
            His word.<br><br>
            Bless the Lord, all you His hosts, You ministers of
            His, who do His pleasure.
            Bless the Lord, all His works, in all places Of His
            dominion.<br><br>
            Bless the Lord, O my soul</div>
          <li onclick="togglePrayer('psalm142')">Psalm 142(143)</li>
          <div id="psalm142" class="prayer-content" style="display:none;">Hear my prayer, O Lord, Give ear to my
            supplications! In Your faithfulness answer me, and
            in Your righteousness. Do not enter into judgment
            with Your servant. For in Your sight no one living
            is righteous.<br><br>
            For the enemy has persecuted my soul; He has
            crushed my life to the ground; He has made me
            dwell in darkness. Like those who have long been
            dead. Therefore, my spirit is overwhelmed within
            me; My heart within me is distressed.<br><br>
            I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your
            works; I muse on the work of Your hands. I spread
            out my hands to You; My soul longs for You like a
            thirsty land. Selah<br><br>
            Answer me speedily, O Lord; My spirit fails! Do not
            hide Your face from me, Lest I be like those who go
            down into the pit. Cause me to hear Your
            lovingkindness in the morning, For in You do I
            trust; Cause me to know the way in which I should
            walk, For I lift up my soul to You.<br><br>
            Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies; In You I take
            shelter. Teach me to do Your will, For You are my
            God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of
            uprightness.<br><br>
            Revive me, O Lord, for Your name's sake! For Your
            righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
            In Your mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all
            those who afflict my soul; For I am Your servant.</div>
